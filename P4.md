# Overloading vs Overriding in Java
###### By Bradley Pirie, Syracuse University | 10MAY2021

In languages like Java, programmers are able to make use of different object oriented programming (OOP) features like encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, etc. These concepts, combined with objects, classes, and methods, help programs represent real-life scenarios and offer a unique way to solve problems. Now this is just a breif overview of OOP, if you'd like to learn more about these ideas you can find a more indepth explanation ***[here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-oops-concept-in-java/)***. For the purpose of this article we will assume that you already know what OOP is as well as some of the core concepts that go along with it. Here we will take a deeper look into method overloading and method overriding in Java.

### What is method overloading?

Method overloading occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name but each method has a different signature. Signitures can differ by argument type or by the number of arguments being passed. When deciding which method corresponds to any given call, Java will choose the method who's signature matches what is being called.

```java
// For example the following class has multiple print methods
// that all have different signatures. The print method is being
// overloaded

public class Printer {
  public static void print() {                            // First print method takes no arguments
    System.out.println("Printing ...");
    }
  public static void print(int x) {                       // Second print method takes just an int
    System.out.printf("Printing %d messeges ...\n", x);
  }
  public static int print(int x, int y) {                 // Third print method takes 2 ints and
    int result = (x >= y ? x : y);                        // selects the larger of the two
    System.out.printf("Printing %d messeges ...\n", result);
    return result;
  }
  public static void print(String messege) {              // Fourth print method takes a string
    System.out.println("Printing the following messege: " + messege);
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    print();                  // This matches the print method with no arguments
    print(5);                 // This matches the print method with 1 int arg
    print(8, 11);             // This matches the print method with 2 int args
    print("Hello world");     // This matches the print method with 1 String arg
  }
}
```

Running the main method above we can expect the following output

```
Printing ...
Printing 5 messeges ...
Printing 11 messeges ...
Printing the following messege: Hello world
```

Notice that each method has the same name, Java distinguishes which method should be used by matching the signatures. In the example above, the print method can be called with no args, 1 int arg, 2 int args, or 1 String arg. This is beneficial because you do not need to create and remember different method names for tasks that are all very similar. As we can see each print method is just a minor variation of the others.
